Case study of blockchain based rice trading platform
Unicsoft developed and distributed system for food product exchanges and commercialization. It is a sophisticated online marketplace that connects rice exporters, importers, and inspection companies in one place to trade and commercialize rice in a more effective, secure, transparent, and effective manner, they decided to build a decentralized rice trading marketplace Since there was no common platform that would put all the rice market participants under one umbrella, the idea was to build a holistic ledger platform that would become the preferred place for market participants to trade rice.

The outcome of the project includes: Digital entities that market players use to interoperate; Digital interfaces and sequences that mimic the process, including PDF contracts generator; Blockchain based digital system that immutably stores all the information and interactions or transactions history; Digital keys issued by Certificates of Authority; Tokens [ability to quickly process transactions]; Blockchain smart contracts.

With this project, we can see the impact of Blockchain techonology to general market. Not only the application on financial market, but also for international trading market, for our online trading, even apply to our daliy use. This would be the trend of future life, and the application of this project's successsion would reflect the application of new technology.
